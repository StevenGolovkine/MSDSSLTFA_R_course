So, we can request these APIs as any other APIs, like what we did in previous sections. Here, we will use [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co) APIs to access to LLM.\n\nThis first step to do is to create a HuggingFace account and set a token. Once the account is created, we click on your profile (top-right of the page), *Settings > Access Tokens*. Once the token has been generated, it need to be added to every requests sent to HuggingFace APIs.\n\n\n## Additional resources\n",
