Unlike an R script file which only contains code and comments, an R Markdown or Quarto file is a plain text file that contains 3 pieces of content:\n    \n1. code chunks\n2. text and narrative \n3. meta data (tells it how to render the output)\n\nThey can be used to create high-quality, fully reproducible, shareable and interactive reports.\n\n## What is R Markdown/Quarto?\n\nAn R Markdown/Quarto file is represented on the @fig-rmarkdown. At the top of the file, the meta data (or YAML) which is surrounded by the dashes. The YAML will dictate how the file is rendered, what the colour scheme is, etc. Next we can see a code chunk which starts with 3 backticks and ends with 3 backticks. Finally, we add some text, with some simple text formatting (Sections, Headers, bullets, italics, bolding, etc) which will be the narrative we want to include alongside our analysis.\n\n::: {#fig-rmarkdown}\n\n![](./images/rmarkdown.png)\n\nR Markdown / Quarto file.\n\n:::\n\nR Markdown/Quarto supports dozens of static and dynamic output formats. These include scientific/technical articles, CVs, Word and PDF documents, presentation slides, dashboards, websites and books, all created using the same general format (code chunks, text and meta data). This website is created using Quarto.\n\nWhen you **knit** (or **render**) your R Markdown/Quarto file, it will generate an output file in the format of your choice (e.g. HTML, Word, PDF, slides, book, etc). When rendering the output, it will run and execute the code embedded in the file, which means that it will dynamically update any tables, plots or results that you want to create. No more copying and pasting images and numbers from R into Word. You can then easily share your output file with colleagues.\n\n## R Markdown/Quarto workflow\n\nWe will follow when using R Markdown/Quarto:\n\n1. Open a .Rmd file in RStudio using *File > New File > R Markdown* for R Markdown file and open a .qmd file in RStudio using *File > New File > Quarto Document* for Quarto file.\n2. Embed your code in code chunks.\n3. Write text and add tables, figures, images, and citations as necessary.\n4. Set the output format and options in the YAML header.\n5. Save and render (knit) the document.\n6. Share your work (which could be in a Word document or HTML document or dashboard, etc.)\n    \n## Getting started\n\nTo run R Markdown/Quarto, you will need to download and install some packages. R Studio will prompt you to install them. You do not need to load this package explicitly in the R Markdown file using the library command, it loads automatically for you. One other thing to note is if you want to render your files to PDF format, you will also need to download and install the `tinytex` package.    \n\nWhen creating new R Markdown/Quarto file, a pop-up window appears (@fig-new-doc). Creating a Document is the most common option but there are also options to create a presentation, a shiny app or open a host of other templates such as CVs, academic papers, posters, etc. By default when you select one of these options, RStudio will open a template document to get you started.  If you wanted to open a blank document, then you would click on the \"Create Empty Document\" button at the bottom of the screen. There are three output formats listed (the default is HTML), but PDF and Word are also available.\n\n::: {#fig-new-doc}\n\n![](./images/new_document.png)\n\nOpen a new document.\n\n:::\n\nOnce the file is created, you should see a \"Knit\" button that will be used to render the file. From @fig-rmarkdown, in the YAML header there are two lines. The first line is \"title\" and the report is “Untitled” currently. The second line is the output which defaults to html_document. Therefore this file, when rendered, will produce a HTML file. Next, we see a code chunk (surrounded by 3 backticks). We can also see some plain text. There is a section header created with the hash symbols, there is an embedded link.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nWhen working with R Markdown or Quarto files, knit your file early (when it is small) and then knit regularly as you are building the complexity or length of the file up. This makes debugging much easier.\n\n:::\n\n## What is YAML?\n\nEvery R Markdown document starts with a YAML header. The options or settings that we choose to specify in the YAML header, customises how the output file is rendered and how it looks. There are many options to choose from. For example, you can choose what the default output type is when you knit the file (HTML, PDF, or Word). You can include a table of contents, section numbers, etc.\n\nThe default YAML header in the template file is\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Untitled\"\noutput: html_document\n---\n```\n\nThe rendered document will be in HTML format. The rendered HTML file will have a title called \"Untitled\".\n\nAdding the name of the report author and the date of the report is straightforward. We add two new options to the YAML, namely author and the date.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"My first document\"\nauthor: \"Steven\"\ndate:  \"08 August, 2024\"\noutput: html_document\n---\n```\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nIf you want to use the most recent date and update it automatically, you can use a line of R code as shown here beside the date option:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndate:  \"`r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y')`\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\nAdding a table of contents for ease of navigation is a good idea, particularly for large reports. To do so, we include a sub-heading in the output section:\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"My first document\"\nauthor: \"Steven\"\ndate:  \"08 August, 2024\"\noutput: \n  html_document:\n    toc: true\n---\n```\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nThe `html_document` has moved to the next line with a `:` at the end. This has tabbed in by one. The toc must be tabbed in twice. \n:::\n\nNext, let's number the document sections. The YAML will be:\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"My first document\"\nauthor: \"Steven\"\ndate:  \"08 August, 2024\"\noutput: \n  html_document:\n    toc: true\n    number_sections: true\n---\n```\n\nOne thing to note when using the `number_sections` option, is that you need to use HEADER 1 i.e. use **# Header name** in the document. This is because HEADER 2 headers, i.e. **## Header name**, will be numbered with decimal points. \n\nThemes change how the rendered file will be styled. There are many themes including: default, bootstrap, cerulean, cosmo, darkly, flatly, journal, lumen, paper, readable, sandstone, simplex, spacelab, united, and yeti. You can also create your own theme using CSS.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"My first document\"\nauthor: \"Steven\"\ndate:  \"08 August, 2024\"\noutput: \n  html_document:\n    toc: true\n    number_sections: true\n    theme: flatly\n---\n```\n\nThe font, colour, link colour, etc. are all changed!\n\n\n## Including text\n\nWhen writing a report, we don’t just include pictures and tables. It’s essential that we provide some narrative around what the analysis is showing and summarising the work. R Markdown/Quarto allows us to include various text components in a document. These include bolding and italicising text, creating bulleted and numbered lists and sub-lists, creating sections with section headers and sub-sections, and so on.\n\nR markdown and Quarto use the Markdown syntax to render text. You can find this syntax [here](https://www.markdownguide.org) for example.\n\n\n## Including code chunks\n\nIncluding code chunks in an RMarkdown/Quarto document allows us to easily modify the rendered or knitted output file.\n\nThere are several ways to include an R code chunk.\n\n1.\tUse a keyboard shortcut for your Mac (⌘ + ⎇ + i) or Windows (Ctrl + Alt + i) machine.\n2.\tIn the RStudio IDE, click on Code and then Insert chunk.\n3.\tMake a code chunk with three back ticks followed by an r in curly brackets. End the chunk with three back ticks. Like that:\n````markdown\n```{r}\n```\n````\n\nThe r part of the code chunk tells Markdown that R is the code engine. However, many different engines can be used such as Python, C, Julia amongst a few.\n\nTo modify how the chunks are run, multiple options are available. The most common are:\n\n* `eval`: If set to `FALSE`, the code is not evaluated, but still print in the output file.\n\n* `include`: If set to `FALSE`, the code is evaluated but nothing is print in the output file. This is the option to use if you are doing lots of calculations and do not want these to be in your final report.\n\n* `echo`: If set to `FALSE`, the code is evaluated, and only the results will be print in the output file.\n\nThere are lots of other chunk options. For example, setting the values of `fig.height`, `fig.width`, `fig.align` will change the size and alignment of the outputted graph(s). Setting the `message` and `warning` options to `FALSE` will ensure that and warnings or messages that are printed when running a code chunk will not appear in the output file. The list of chunk options are [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html) for R Markdown and [here](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html) for Quarto.\n\n\nCode chunks can be run on their own, by clicking the green arrow on the top right hand side of the chunk or all together, by knitting the file. Pay attention that the Markdown environment and R Console are **separate** environments.\n\nOne chunk is special – the setup chunk. This always appears at the top of the Markdown file and in it you can set global options, i.e. all of the code chunks that are created after the setup chunk will inherit these options. \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example\n\nIn this example, include is set to FALSE, which means that the set-up chunk code won’t appear in the rendered output file. Within the setup chunk, the default behaviour is to set echo to true, i.e. the code will be displayed in the output file.\n\n````\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)\n```\n````\n\n:::\n\n## Additional resources\n\n\n- The book [R Markdown: the Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).\n\n- The RStudio R Markdown [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf).\n\n- The [RMarkdown reference guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf?_ga=2.229584860.1166261784.1645476210-1869785281.1598968492).\n\n- The Quarto [website](https://quarto.org).\n\n\n<br><br>\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 0.875em;\"}\n[Back](/weeks/week-5.qmd) ⏎\n:::",
