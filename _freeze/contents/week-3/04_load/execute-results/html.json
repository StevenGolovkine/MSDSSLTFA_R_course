Specific procedures ensure correct mapping to the target schema.\n\nIn this section, we will focus on the exportation of the data into an `.csv` file or an `.rds` file. You can also populate a SQL database, but it is outside the scope of the material. Please refer to the documentation of the `DBI` package for more information.\n\n## Export as a csv file\n\nA `.csv` file is a plain text file format used for storing tabular data. It is a widely used. Each line represents a row of data, and values within each row are separated by commas. CSV files are versatile and can be easily created, edited, and read using a wide range of software applications, including spreadsheet programs and text editors. It is a popular choice for data exchange and data storage as you can export the data using R and use the file with various other software.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example\n\nUsing the dataset created in the previous section, we can save it as a `.csv` file using:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwrite_csv(dataset_join, \"./path/lord_of_the_rings.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nWe can load `.csv` files using the function `read_csv()`.\n\n## Export as a rds file\n\nAn `.rds` file is a binary file format used in R for storing data objects. It encapsulates data and preserves the structure of R objects, making it a convenient choice for saving and sharing data in a compact and platform-independent (OS) manner. RDS files are often employed when the exact structure and content of an R object need to be preserved for future use or sharing with others. They provide a straightforward way to store data for analysis or to transport data between R sessions, but they can only be loaded in R...\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example\n\nUsing the dataset created in the previous section, we can save it as a `.rds` file using:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwrite_rds(dataset_join, \"./path/lord_of_the_rings.rds\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nWe can load `.rds` files using the function `read_rds()`.\n\n\n## Additional resources\n\n* An [introduction](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/articles/dbi) to DBI.\n\n<br><br>\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 0.875em;\"}\nBack to [week 03](/weeks/week-3.qmd) ‚èé\n:::",
