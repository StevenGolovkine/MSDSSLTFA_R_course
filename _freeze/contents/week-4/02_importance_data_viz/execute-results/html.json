This example shows its importance.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example\n\nHere we have two numeric variables $x$ and $y$ and $4$ different datasets that have been generated. Let’s pretend that we do not plot the data and instead calculate numerical summaries, mean of $x$ and $y$, variance of $x$ and $y$, correlation coefficient between $x$ and $y$, which is a number describing how strong the relationship is between $x$ and $y$, and regression line. In all $4$ datasets, the value of these numerical summaries are exactly the same. \n\nWhat does that tell us without a plot? Effectively nothing. Here’s why. Look now at the plots for each dataset. You should immediately notice how different the patterns are. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](02_importance_data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the upper left plot, there is an even spread of points in both axes. In the upper right plot, we have a curved relationship. In the bottom plots, there are clumps of points with a single large outlier.\n\nThis example is known as the Anscombe quartet [@anscombe1973].\n\n:::\n\nSometimes, the numerical summary gives us no meaningfull information about the different dataset. If we were modelling these datasets, we would choose very different models depending on what the plot showed.\n\n## \"Bad\" data visualisation\n\n\nThe lie factor\n\n## \"Good\" data visualisation\n\nIn his book, @tufte2001 propose some principles for displaying quantitative information:\n\n* **Data**: Above all, show the data.\n\n* **Question**: Induce the viewer to think about the substance rather than about methodology, graphic design. Encourage the eye to compare different piece of data.\n\n* **Data-ink ratio**: Maximise the data-ink ratio. Erase all non data ink and redundant information.\n\n* **Integrity**: Avoid distorting what the data have to say.\n\n* **General to specific**: Reveal the data at different levels of detail, from broad picture to fine struture.\n\n* **Context**: Graphical display should be closely integrated with statistical and verbal descriptions of the data set.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nTo explain Tufte principles, consider distribution of a continuous variable  on $5$ groups. We first use the default R function `boxplot`. We see that this plot is quite full.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](02_importance_data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAfter erasing all non data ink, all redundant information and show the data, we obtain the following plot. Do you think that we have lost anything?\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](02_importance_data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nBe careful to keep all your audience. For example, there are an estimated 300 million people in the world with color vision deficiency[^1]. Around 8% of men and 0.5% of women are colorblind. In `ggplot`, you can use the function `scale_colour_colorblind()` to create a color palette color-blind friendly.\n\n[^1]: [https://clintoneye.com/services/color-blindness/](https://clintoneye.com/services/color-blindness/)\n\n:::\n\nAs this course is not about data visualisation, you may refer to @tufte2001 and @chen2008 for more information about data visualisation theory.\n\n## References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::",
