This execution occurs in real-time as the program is written in the R language. Interpreting code offers dynamic and interactive typing, allowing for flexibility in coding. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of reliability since there is no static type-checking typical of a compiled language. Additionally, interpreting code might lead to slower execution compared to natively compiled machine code.\n\nTo enhance computational speed and integrate C++ into R, we will write C++ code and call it from R. This approach offers the advantage of faster computations while ensuring that the results are readily available within the R environment.\n\nIn this section, we will use the package `Rcpp`. If it is not already installed, do it and then load it. Pay attention that you would need a C++ compiler.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(Rcpp)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Getting started with C++\n\nWe can create `.cpp` file easily within RStudio. We can do it with *File > New File > C++ File*. In this file, we will put our C++ code. When a new file is created, it already has some code in it.\n\n```c\n#include <Rcpp.h>  // To use Rcpp functions\nusing namespace Rcpp;  // To add Rcpp functions in the namespace\n\n// [[Rcpp::export]]  // To make the function available in R\nNumericVector timesTwo(NumericVector x) {\n  return x * 2;\n}\n```\n\nWhen we click on the *Source* button, R will compile the function and then we will be able to use our C++ function as any other function in R. (We could also use the function `Rcpp::sourceCpp()` to source the file.) We can call `timesTwo(42)` from the R Console and the function is available in the *Environment* pane. There is also a possibiltiy to test the function directly from the C++ file using the following snippet.\n\n```c\n/*** R\ntimesTwo(42)\n*/\n```\n\nThis function has been compiled and `Rcpp` constructed an R function that connects to the compiled function. So, the R function call C++ code. If we look at the body of the R function, we see something like:\n```r\nfunction (x) \n.Call(<pointer: 0x106c96aec>, x)\n```\n\n## Some C++ syntax\n\nCreating functions in C++ require explicit type declarations and syntax. The creation has a similar syntax than function calls. We need to declare the return type of the function. For example, to return a single integer, we specify `int`, for character, `String`, for boolean, `bool`, etc. Common types for R vectors are represented in C++ as `NumericVector`, `IntegerVector`, `CharacterVector`, and `LogicalVector`.\nWe must explicitely use the `return` statement. Each statement is terminated by a semicolon (`;`).\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example\n\nHere is the comparison between functions with no input, and simple output in R and C++.\n\n```r\none <- function() 1L\n```\n\n```c\nint one() {\n  return 1;\n}\n```\n\n:::\n\nEvery variable declaration must include a specified type. It is the responsibility of the programmer to explicitly state the type for each variable. Unlike some other programming languages, C++ does not attempt to deduce or guess the variable type; we must be explicit in our type declarations. This strict typing system in C++ helps ensure clarity and precision in code.\n\nIn C++, methods are called with a full stop (`.`). For example, if we want the size of a vector `x`, we will call `x.size()`.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nWhen dealing with vectors in C++, it is important to note that indexing begins at 0, whereas in R, indexing starts at 1. This discrepancy in indexing can lead to off-by-one errors when translating code between the two languages.\n\n:::\n\nThe package `Rcpp` also provides wrapper for all other base R data types. For example, we have access to list (`Lisst`), data frames (`DataFrame`) and functions (`Functions`).\n\n## The Standard Template Library\n\nThe use of C++ starts to be interesting when we have to implement more complex algorithms. The Standard Template Library (STL) contains widely used data structures and algorithms, like iterators, maps or sets.\n\nTo use the available algorithms in the STL, we need to add the `<algorithm>` header at the top of the `.cpp` file.\n```c\n#include <algorithm>\n```\nUsing algorithms from the STL is often preferable to develop our own (if it is available of course) because it provides efficiency, correctness, and maintainability. STL algorithms are designed by C++ professionals, prioritising efficiency. Moreover, they have undergone rigorous testing over time, ensuring reliability. The common functions that we will use in R are implemented in the STL.\n\nThe STL provides a larger set of data structures. The most important are `vector`, `unordered_set` and `unordered_map`. The `vector` is similar to an R vector, except that we need to specify which type the elements of the vector will have. For example, a vector that contains integers is declared as `vector<int>`. The `unordered_set` contains unordered unique set of values. We have to add `#include <unordered_set>` as a header to use `unordered_set`. The `unordered_map` may contains data represented as key/value pairs. It is similar to `list` in R. When initialised, we need to specify the type of both the keys and values, e.g. `unordered_map<int, String>`.\n\nWe will not go into more details here. Consider reading `Rcpp` documentation for more insights.\n\n## Additional resources\n\n* Rcpp [website](https://www.rcpp.org).\n\n* Advanced R book, [Chapter 25](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/rcpp.html).\n\n* Standard Template Library, [algortihms](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm).\n\n* Standard Template Library, [containers](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container).\n\n<br><br>\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 0.875em;\"}\nBack to [week 10](/weeks/week-10.qmd) ‚èé\n:::",
