Packages are a collection of functions, data and documentation that are created to perform a particular task(s). Some packages are part of the base R installation (e.g., `base`, `mgcv`, `nlme`, `stats`, ...). Others can be downloaded and installed from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html). Packages can be created and shared by anyone in the R community.\n\n## Downloading and installing packages\n\nThere are two steps when using additional packages:\n\n1. Download and install the package\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"package_name\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n2. Load the package in R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(package_name)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn RStudio, we also have the option of using the `Packages` tab and clicking on `Install`.\n\n::: {#fig-r-install}\n![](./images/install.png)\n\nInstall package.\n:::\n\n\nIn the pop-up, type in the package name (without quotes), make sure the `Install dependencies` box is ticked and click `Install`.\n\n::: {#fig-r-install_popup}\n![](./images/install_popup.png)\n\nInstallation pop-up window.\n:::\n\n\n## Loading packages\n\nOnce the package has been downloaded (the `>` will appear in the R console), it must be **loaded** into R to use it. This is achieved using\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(package_name)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe usually have a series of these commands at the top of a script file, loading all of the packages we will use for the analysis. If you terminate your session, you will need to reload the relevant packages again. RStudio has the option to use the `Packages` tab to load packages where all of the downloaded packages are listed.\n\n::: {#fig-r-loaded}\n![](./images/loaded.png)\n\nLoaded package.\n:::\n\n\n## Updating packages\n\nPackages are often updated and new versions become available on CRAN for download. It is a good practice to keep packages updated. To download and install the latest version, run\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nupdate.packages(\"package_name\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn RStudio, there is an `Update` button in the `Packages` tab that does the same thing.\n\n## Warnings when loading packages\n\nSometimes, you will get a warning when loading a package:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(MASS)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'MASS'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    select\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis means that the `dplyr` package and the `MASS` package have a function named `select()`. In this case, it is preferable to specify which function you want to use:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndplyr::select(...)  # For the dplyr function\nMASS::select(...)   # For the MASS function\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Additional resources\n\n- R manual by the R Core Team, [Section 13 on packages](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Packages).\n\n<br><br>\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 0.875em;\"}\nBack to [week 01](/weeks/week-1.qmd) ‚èé\n:::",
