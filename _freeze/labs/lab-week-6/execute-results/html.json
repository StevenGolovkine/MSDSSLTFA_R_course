This dashboard will include Shiny components as well as interactive plots, created wiht `plotly`. To accomplish this, we will work with a dataset related to energy, sourced from the [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/energy) webiste. The complete dataset is available [here](https://github.com/owid/energy-data) and some information about the dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-06-06/readme.md). We will use a slightly modified version of the dataset available [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-06-06/readme.md). To plot the map of the world, you can use the data provided [here](./ressources/countries.geojson).\n\n\n1. Create an empty `flexdashboard`.\n\n2. Load the dataset to make it available to the dashboard.\n\n3. Change the title of the dashboard and a description of the dataset as a header.\n\nFirst, we will use the default layout to incorporate graphs.\n\n4. Create a plot of the evolution of the population of a country through the year. Add a Shiny widget to select the country in the dataset. Present the population in millions. \n\n5. Propose an interactive plot (in `plotly`) that show the relationship between the population and the GDP. The interactivity may come from the different years. Make sure to remove the `World` from the dataset and `NA`s. Present the population in millions, the GDP in billions and use a log scale. \n\n6. Create a specific plot for the population and GDP of the world. Make a cumulative animation using the year.\n\nNow, we will add a new page in the dashboard, and put some statistical plots into it.\n\n7. Create a new page in the dashboard.\n\n8. Plot a violin of the ratio between renewables electricity (`renewables_electricity`) and fossil electricity (`fossil_electricity`) for each year.\n\n9. Create a map of the world colored with the ratio between the demand and generation of electricity. You will need the `leaflet` package.\n\n10. Add a table containing all the information for a given country. Make sure it is possible to select which country is shown.\n\n\nFinally, we will modify the theme of the dahsboard.\n\n12. Look at the different available themes [here](https://bootswatch.com) and change the dashboard theme.\n\n13. Use custom theming to change the font of the dashboard.\n\n<br><br>\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 0.875em;\"}\n[Back](/weeks/week-6.qmd) ‚èé\n:::",
