Today's tutorial has two primary objectives. First, it aims to provide you with hands-on experience in Exploratory Data Analysis and reporting the findings. Second, you will work with examples of "bad" data visualizations, analyse their shortcomings, and explore ways to enhance them.

## Part 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis

We work with a dataset related to Pokemon, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mariotormo/complete-pokemon-dataset-updated-090420?select=pokedex_%28Update_05.20%29.csv). We will use a modified version of the dataset available [here](/labs/ressources/pokemon.csv).

0. Load the data.

1. Count the number of Pokemon for each type (use only `type_1`), and compute their proportions and percentages. Create a bar plot with these results. Comments on the distribution.

2. Do the same for each individual generation. Create a bar plot for each generation. Comments on the distribution, compare specifically with the distribution from the previous question. 

3. Plot the distribution of heights. Comments on the distribution (mean, median skewness, ...).

4. Plot the distribution of attack. Try different number of bins in the histogram. 

5. Plot a boxplot of the attack per type and per generation. Comment your results.

6. Plot a scatter plot of the attack vs the defense. Create one per generation and one per type. 

7. Create a small summary of your findings on this dataset.


## Part 2 - "Bad" data visualisation

For each of the following plots, identify the issues and propose an improved version of each plot. The data for all the figures are [here](/labs/ressources/data_week4.rds).
