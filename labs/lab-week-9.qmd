<br>
The aim of today's tutorial is to find and fix bugs in R functions and do some profiling of common R functions to see if some optimisation is feasible.

## Fixing bugs

For the following code snippets, find and fix the bugs using `browser()` and `debug()`. It may have multiple bugs in each snippets.

```{r}
#| eval: false
calc_factorial <- function(n) {
    result <- 0
    for (i in 1:n) {
        result <- result * i
    }
    return(result)
}
```


## Profiling code

Do the profiling of the following functions with different inputs and try to understand if they can optimised in some way.
