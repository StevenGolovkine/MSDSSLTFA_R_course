Simulation involves using computational methods to model and mimic real-world scenarios or processes. It allows for the generation of data or outcomes based on specified assumptions, providing insights into the behavior of complex systems. We have access to a wide range of functions and packages for conducting simulations, from statistical distributions to complex dynamical processes. Through simulation, we can test hypotheses and assess the impact of different variables.
