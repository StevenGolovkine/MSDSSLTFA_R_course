Data visualisation plays a crucial role in the exploration of datasets. Specifically, it facilitates both exploratory data analysis and the generation of statistical plots. Through these visualizations, patterns, trends, and/or potential outliers within the data can be identified, aiding to understand the underlying relationships. Exploratory data analysis involves the initial visual inspection of data, while statistical plots encompass a range of graphics used to depict distributions, correlations, and statistical summaries.

The `tidyverse` library is assumed to be loaded for all materials:

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(tidyverse)
```
