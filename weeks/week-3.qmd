Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) constitutes a process in data warehousing. This process involves extracting data from diverse sources, subsequently transforming it into a structure compatible with data warehouse requirements, and ultimately loading it into the designated repository. ETL encompasses the following three stages:

* Extract data from various sources;

* Transform data into a suitable format for loading into the data warehouse;

* Load data into data warehouse.

The `tidyverse` library is assumed to be loaded for all materials:

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(tidyverse)
```
