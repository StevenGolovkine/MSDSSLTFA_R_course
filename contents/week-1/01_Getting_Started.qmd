## Using R

The primary way to use R is through a command-line interface. To access the R
console via a terminal, simply enter the `R` command. To create an R script,
open your preferred text editor and save the file with a `.R` extension, for
example `script.R`. The script can then be executed using the command:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
Rscript script.R
```

## Using R with Rgui

Rgui is a program that is installed alongside R when you install it. It is the
standard R user interface. But nobody uses it...

## Using R with RStudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) designed primarily for
running R code. It adds many more features and tools to R that allow us to
create, e.g.: 

- reproducible data analyses (via Rmarkdown/Quarto);
- interactive dashboarding tools (via RShiny).

It is now possible to run Python code, C++ code, SQL queries, ... directly from RStudio.
