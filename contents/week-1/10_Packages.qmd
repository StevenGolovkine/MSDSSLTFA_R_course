Much of R functionality is provided via packages. Packages are a collection of functions, data and documentation that are created to perform a particular task(s). Some packages are part of the base R installation (e.g., `base`, `mgcv`, `nlme`, `stats`, ...). Others can be downloaded and installed from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html). Packages can be created and shared by anyone in the R community.

## Downloading and installing packages

There are two steps when using additional packages:

1. Download and install the package

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| class-output: outputcode
install.packages("package_name")
```

2. Load the package in R

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| class-output: outputcode
library(package_name)
```

In RStudio, we also have the option of using the `Packages` tab and clicking on `Install`.

::: {#fig-r-install}

Install package.

In the pop-up, type in the package name (without quotes), make sure the `Install dependencies` box is ticked and click `Install`.

![](./images/install_popup.png)

Installation pop-up window.

## Loading packages

Once the package has been downloaded (the `>` will appear in the R console), it must be **loaded** into R to use it. This is achieved using

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| class-output: outputcode
library(package_name)
```

We usually have a series of these commands at the top of a script file, loading all of the packages we will use for the analysis. If you terminate your session, you will need to reload the relevant packages again. RStudio has the option to use the `Packages` tab to load packages where all of the downloaded packages are listed.

## Updating packages

Packages are often updated and new versions become available on CRAN for download. It is a good practice to keep packages updated. To download and install the latest version, run

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| class-output: outputcode
update.packages("package_name")
```

In RStudio, there is an `Update` button in the `Packages` tab that does the same thing.

## Warnings when loading packages

Sometimes, you will get a warning when loading a package:

```{r load_dplyr, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| class-output: outputcode
library(dplyr)
```

```{r load_package}
#| eval: true
#| class-output: outputcode
library(MASS)
```

This means that the `dplyr` package and the `MASS` package have a function named `select()`. In this case, it is preferable to specify which function you want to use:

```{r functions, eval=FALSE}
#| eval: false
#| class-output: outputcode
dplyr::select(...)  # For the dplyr function
MASS::select(...)   # For the MASS function
```
