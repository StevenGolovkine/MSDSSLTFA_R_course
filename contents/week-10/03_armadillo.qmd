Armadillo is a linear algebra library for the C++ language. The `RcppArmadillo` package provides an interface from R to and from Armadillo by utilising the `Rcpp` package.

We need to add these lines in the header of the `.cpp` file.
```c
#include <RcppArmadillo.h>
// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppArmadillo)]]
```


We can alternatively use the `RcppEigen` package, that uses the C++ `Eigen` library as a backend for linear algebra tasks. Both packages offer comparable features, making the choice between them a matter of personal preference.
