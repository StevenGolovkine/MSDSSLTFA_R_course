The process of Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) is a cornerstone of data warehousing. It commences with the extraction of data from heterogeneous sources, followed by the transformation of this data into a format that adheres to the prerequisites of the data warehouse. The final step involves the loading of the processed data into the designated repository.
